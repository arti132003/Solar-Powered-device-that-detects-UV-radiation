# Solar-Powered-device-that-detects-UV-radiation

This project presents the development of a solar-powered  device capable of detecting UV radiation levels, providing  alerts to users, and simultaneously measuring SpO2 (blood oxygen saturation) and heart rate.         The device integrates an ESP32 microcontroller for data processing and communication, a MAX30010 biopotential analog front-end (AFE) for accurate heart rate monitoring, and a GUVA-S12SD UV sensor for UV radiation detection. The integration of solar panels ensures sustainable and continuous operation, reducing dependence on external power sources.
 
Users will receive alerts when UV radiation levels reach potentially harmful levels, allowing for timely protection measures. Additionally, the device provides essential health monitoring features by continuously measuring SpO2 and heart rate, empowering users to track their well-being conveniently. The combination of these functionalities makes the device a versatile tool for outdoor enthusiasts, healthcare professionals, and individuals concerned about UV exposure and health monitoring.
Key features of the device include its solar-powered design, which ensures sustainability and long-lasting operation without the need for frequent recharging. The wearable nature of the device allows for seamless integration into daily routines, enabling users to stay informed about UV exposure levels and their health status while on the go.

Overall, this project aims to enhance user awareness of UV radiation exposure while providing valuable health monitoring capabilities in a convenient and wearable form factor. The combination of UV detection, health monitoring, and solar-powered operation makes this device a promising tool for promoting both sun safety and personal well-being in outdoor settings.
